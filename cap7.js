/* 
1 - Measuring a robot
It’s hard to objectively compare robots by just letting them solve a few scenarios. 
Maybe one robot just happened to get easier tasks or the kind of tasks that it is good at, 
whereas the other didn’t.

Write a function compareRobots that takes two robots (and their starting memory). 
It should generate 100 tasks and let each of the robots solve each of these tasks. 
When done, it should output the average number of steps each robot took per task.

For the sake of fairness, make sure you give each task to both robots, 
rather than generating different tasks per robot.

2 - Robot efficiency
Can you write a robot that finishes the delivery task faster than goalOrientedRobot? 
If you observe that robot’s behavior, what obviously stupid things does it do? How could those be improved?

If you solved the previous exercise, you might want to use your compareRobots function to verify 
whether you improved the robot.

/* 
3 - Persistent group
Most data structures provided in a standard JavaScript environment aren’t very well suited for persistent use. 
Arrays have slice and concat methods, which allow us to easily create new arrays without damaging the old one. 
But Set, for example, has no methods for creating a new set with an item added or removed.

Write a new class PGroup, similar to the Group class from Chapter 6, which stores a set of values. Like Group, 
it has add, delete, and has methods.

Its add method, however, should return a new PGroup instance with the given member added and leave the old one unchanged. 
Similarly, delete creates a new instance without a given member.

The class should work for values of any type, not just strings. It does not have to be efficient when used with 
large amounts of values.

The constructor shouldn’t be part of the class’s interface (though you’ll definitely want to use it internally). 
Instead, there is an empty instance, PGroup.empty, that can be used as a starting value.

Why do you need only one PGroup.empty value, rather than having a function that creates a new, empty map every time?
